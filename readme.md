# Gas Price Comparison in Major Cities in Canada before and after COVID-19 - ETL Pipeline

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gas prices in major cities in Canada. The project uses an ETL pipeline to process and transform the gas price data, and the data is then analyzed to provide insights into the changes in gas prices before and after the pandemic. The project also compares the gas price data with the Crude Oil WTI stock data. The pipeline is built using Pyspark, Apache Airflow, and various AWS services, including Lambda, Glue, EMR, Athena, and S3. The final analytics visuals are created using Apache Superset.
