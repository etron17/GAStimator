# Gas Price Comparison in Major Cities in Canada before and after COVID-19 - ETL Pipeline
## Business Problem
A potential business problem that this project could help address is the impact of fluctuating gas prices on transportation costs and logistics for businesses operating in Canada. The project's insights into the changes in gas prices before and after the COVID-19 pandemic can help businesses plan for transportation expenses and adjust their operations accordingly. This can be especially important for businesses that rely heavily on transportation, such as logistics and delivery companies, and those that operate in multiple cities and regions across Canada. By having a better understanding of the changes in gas prices, businesses can optimize their operations and potentially reduce their costs.


## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gas prices in major cities in Canada. The project uses an ETL pipeline to process and transform the gas price data, and the data is then analyzed to provide insights into the changes in gas prices before and after the pandemic. The project also compares the gas price data with the Crude Oil WTI stock data. The pipeline is built using Pyspark, Apache Airflow, and various AWS services, including Lambda, Glue, EMR, Athena, and S3. The final analytics visuals are created using Apache Superset.
